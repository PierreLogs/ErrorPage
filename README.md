## Overview

![screenshot](img/404-NotFound.png)

<!--Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)-->

See my project on [Github/404-NotFound](https://github.com/Pierre-OL/404-NotFound)
As a practitioner I managed to learn more about css in units, variables, responsive design and upload my demo to the web

**Additional tip:**

- Use github pages to upload my demo
- It is better to use the BEM method
- Deployed by Github
